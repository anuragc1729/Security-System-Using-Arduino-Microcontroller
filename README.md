# Security-System-Using-Arduino-Microcontroller
Creating an Arm and Disarm security system using Arduino Microcontroller .

The functionalities of this ARM and DISARM SECURITY SYSTEM model include :
-  Whenever someone comes near the door/safe , the buzzer starts to beep . to switch the buzzer off , the right password needs to be entered . The length of the password and its correctness are monitored closely .
-  Once the correct password has been entered , then there is an option of wither arming the system again , or the owner can reset the password . Either of the two opeartions can be done by entering a particular sequence of letters/alphabets , which can be modified.
